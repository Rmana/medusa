<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: right;"><b>FAQ</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><B>What is Libra?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Libra serves as UVa’s digital
institutional repository.  Among other features, Libra will allow
scholars to make completed versions of their work—such as preprints
and published articles—freely available to the general public for
non-commercial research, scholarship, teaching and learning, and to
store their work in a central, stable location.  The repository makes
research more visible to a wider audience and helps assure the
long-term preservation of UVa scholars’ works.  The repository
offers a simple interface for uploading publications, and is
searchable so that UVa publications may be discovered by users from
inside or outside the university.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>When and why was Libra developed?
 </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">The University Library has been
working to develop an institutional repository for many years.  The
Libra portal is a collaboration between the library and ITC to
provide a service requested in the Faculty Senate Open Access
Resolution of February 5, 2010.   That resolution encourages each
faculty member at UVa to “reserve a nonexclusive, irrevocable,
non-commercial, global license to exercise any and all rights under
copyright relating to each of her or his scholarly articles, in any
medium, and to authorize others to do the same.”  The resolution
also encourages faculty to submit an electronic copy of each article
to which they have retained rights to the institutional repository.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Why should we have an
institutional repository, and why should you use it?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Many institutions of higher
education have established repositories such as Libra, and are
encouraging faculty to retain rights to enable deposit of scholarly
works in a repository.  These and other open access initiatives (such
as the emergence of free online peer-reviewed journals) have been
individually successful and, if they become broadly successful, have
the potential to transform the scholarly landscape by making research
and scholarship more accessible to the public.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">For more information about critical
issues in scholarly communications, libraries, and open access and
what you can do to help, see the <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/">SPARC</a>
or <a href="http://www.createchange.org/">Create Change</a> websites.
 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>What other institutions have
repositories?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Institutional repositories have been
established at MIT, Harvard, the University of Kansas, and many other
institutions.  Some universities have adopted broad policies
requiring faculty to deposit in the repository, while others such as
UVa strongly encourage but do not require deposit.  While policies
for submission vary from institution to institution, these
repositories contribute to the common goal of expanding and
transforming scholarly communications and publishing.  The
establishment of Libra ensures that UVa has an important tool needed
to participate in this transformation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Who may submit articles to Libra?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Any employee of the University  who
produces scholarly works may deposit items in Libra.  Deposit is
currently not available for students, but the capability to deposit
electronic theses and dissertations will be pilot tested in spring
2011.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><B>What may be submitted?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">While Libra has been developed
specifically as a repository for peer-reviewed, scholarly articles
published in journals and conference proceedings, other works such as
books and book chapters may be deposited as well, as long as
sufficient rights have been retained by the author or authors.  In
the near future, scholars will also be able to deposit data sets.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Articles should be complete and
ready for distribution.  That is, they should be as close as possible
to their final, published version.  Libra is intended as a repository
for completed work in electronic format, analogous to the physical
library as a repository of completed work in print format.   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><B>What file formats are accepted?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">All articles must be submitted in
PDF format.  PDF offers a reasonable assurance of long-term
sustainability and access.   Supporting materials in other formats
(e.g. audio, video, image files) may also be submitted along with a
PDF, although these supplemental files will not have the same
assurance of long-term sustainability and access as files submitted
in PDF format. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Why do I have to agree to the
deposit agreement, and what does it say?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">In order to deliver written works
and other copyrighted materials to the public, Libra must have
consent from the copyright holder.  The deposit agreement asks you,
the author, to confirm that you are the copyright holder, or have
permission from the copyright holder (typically a publisher to whom
you may have transferred the copyright in exchange for publication in
a journal or book).  Libra is not asking you to transfer your
copyright to the University, or to give up any rights you have in the
material to the University.  The Deposit License confirms that you
wish to make the material available through Libra to the public, to
allow certain educational, non-commercial, public uses of the
material, and to allow for preservation by the University. It s a
LIMITED, NON-EXCLUSIVE agreement, meaning you retain all the rights
you had before the item was deposited.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>What rights do I grant the
University when I deposit my work in Libra?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">You grant to the University of
Virginia the right to: 
</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">reproduce and/or distribute
	your submission (including the metadata and abstract) worldwide, in
	any format or medium for non-commercial, academic purposes only. 
	</p>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">migrate the submission, without
	changing the content, to any medium or format, and keep more than
	one copy of your work for purposes of security, back up and
	preservation. 
	</p>
</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">See the full text of the Deposit
License for more information. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>How do I know if I have
permission to deposit my work?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">If the article has been previously
published, you should check the copyright transfer agreement that you
signed at the time of publication.  The agreement may make explicit
reference to your right to deposit in your institution’s digital
repository, along with any specific guidelines to follow.  You can
also check the publisher’s website.  Many major publishers now have
clear statements about Author’s Rights on their websites, and many
are generous in allowing their authors to deposit a pre-print version
of a work in a repository, sometimes after a short embargo period to
allow the publisher to get the work out.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">See these links for some examples of
author’s rights policies from major publishers:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><a href="http://www.springer.com/open+access/authors+rights?SGWID=0-176704-12-683201-0">Springer</a></p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">The <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">SHERPA/RoMEO
site</a> also provides a useful compilation of many major publishers’
policies. 
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><B>How can I deposit in Libra, when
my agreement with a publisher required me to sign over my rights?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">You may have signed an agreement
that turns over all rights to the publisher.  The copyright agreement
may have contained language transferring “exclusive” or “all”
rights to the publisher, for example:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><i>The
undersigned author or authors (‘Author’) of the above article
(‘Article’) transfers and assigns </i><i><b>exclusively</b></i><i>
to _________________(‘Publisher’) </i><i><b>all </b></i><i>Author's
right, title and interest in the Article including, without
limitation, the copyright therein for the full term of copyright and
any extensions or renewals of that term, including but not limited to
the </i><i><b>exclusive</b></i><i> right to publish, republish,
transmit, sell, distribute and otherwise use the Contribution and the
material contained therein in electronic and print editions of the
Journal and in derivative works throughout the world, in all
languages and in all media of expression now known or later
developed, and to license or permit others to do so.</i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Unless another section of your
agreement specifically allows it, this type of broad grant prohibits
you from making the work available to the public through a repository
like Libra without first requesting permission from the publisher.   
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>I’m about to publish, and the
publisher’s agreement requires me to sign over my rights.  What can
I do?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">If your article has not yet been
published, check the copyright transfer agreement.  If it does not
allow you to retain rights to deposit in an institutional repository,
and requires that you transfer “exclusive” or “all” rights to
the publisher, you may be able to amend the agreement prior to
signing.  The <a href="http://www.arl.org/sparc/bm~doc/Access-Reuse_Addendum.pdf">SPARC
addendum</a> provides a useful inventory of the broad rights that an
author might hope to retain.  However, many publishers are unwilling
to accept such an addendum.  A simpler statement that you can write
in or request would be:</p>
<p style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><i><b>Notwithstanding
anything in this agreement to the contrary, I reserve the right to
use this work in my personal teaching and research, and to place an
electronic copy of this work [or, “my final author’s submitted
version of the work”] on a publicly accessible web site for
non-commercial research, teaching, and scholarship.</b></i></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Some work may be subject to the
<a href="http://publicaccess.nih.gov/">National Institutes of Health
Public Access policy</a>.  For information on retaining author’s
rights in order to comply with the NIH policy, see the <a href="http://www.hsl.virginia.edu/portal/researcher/public_access.cfm">NIH
Rules</a> page from the Claude Moore Health Sciences Library website.</p>

</ul>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Will publishers be willing to
accept my article if a pre-publication version is already in Libra?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Publishers have their own policies
about this.  You should be careful not to endanger formal publication
of your work by early deposit in the open access environment of
Libra.  In our experience, some publishers will only publish work if
they have first publication/distribution rights.  In other
disciplines, it is common for pre-publication versions of papers to
circulate freely and not to be seen as competition for the formal
publication.  We view this as a discipline-, publisher-, and
scholar-specific inquiry.  Libra aims to support scholars and
scholarship, never to stand in the way!</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>What is an embargo period?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">A submitter is able to set an
embargo period during which his or her submission is saved in the
repository but not available for public view.   An embargo may be
used to balance publishers’ interests in exclusive distribution and
sale of subscriptions to scholarly journals, while also ensuring that
scholarship is accessible to the public within a reasonable period of
time.  An embargo period may be set by or negotiated with a
publisher; check the publisher’s copyright transfer form for an
embargo period, or see the <a href="http://www.sherpa.ac.uk/romeo/">SHERPA/RoMEO
site</a> for a useful compilation of many major publishers’
policies.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>May I delete or change an item
that I previously submitted to Libra?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Because the repository is meant for
scholarly work that is as close as possible to its final or published
form, items may not be deleted or changed once they are deposited in
Libra.  Scholars should only deposit in Libra the version to which
they intend to provide permanent open access.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Libra does allow for closely related
works to be linked-- for example, a conference paper and subsequent
journal article based on the same.  Faculty may also add links from a
Libra record to a published version of the article on a publisher’s
site.  Access through such links may be limited to members of the UVA
community if the articles are available through paid subscriptions
held by the University Library.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Are there limits on file size and
number of items I may deposit?  </b>
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">At this time, there are no limits on
file size or number of items that may be deposited.  
</P>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Are items in Libra guaranteed to
remain available in perpetuity?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">The library and ITC are committed to
the durability and sustainability of scholarship deposited in Libra,
but it is impossible to make absolute guarantees given constant and
rapid changes in technology. Any content that meets the deposit
requirement of a PDF format will be migrated and other formats will
be considered for migration as technologies make this possible. Libra
uses standard data management practices, including security and
backup procedures, to provide a reasonable assurance that files will
remain retrievable over time.  Since permanent access is not a
guarantee with any technology, we urge scholars to keep personal
copies of their files.  
</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;"><b>Who can access Libra to search
for and download items?  What can users of the repository do with the
content that I have submitted?</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0.14in; text-align: left;">Libra is an open access repository,
meaning that anyone can search, view and download content.  Users are
required to agree to the <b>Terms of Use</b> stated on the Libra site
before accessing content. Those terms make clear that only
non-commercial educational uses are permitted, and that unless
otherwise stated on the work itself, the copyright holder for each
work retains all rights associated with the works deposited in Libra.
 As with any other copyrighted work, others may use the work as
allowed by the &quot;fair use&quot; provisions in U.S. copyright law.</p>
