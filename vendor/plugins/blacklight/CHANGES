15820ff added module comments
18b64db construct solr search params using param[:search_field] to look up qt and other config in new style search field config hashes, using SearchField helpers. Still defaults to raw :qt if not found, for backwards compatibility with existing bookmarked results urls.
4a188f2 cucumber features know that param will be :search_field, a key from new style search field config hashes, not :qt

35dc3e3 new get_search_results return values. This file doesn't currently actually contain any tests, but changed before(:each) so it should work when it does.
dacbe0f new return values of get_search_results. @document_list ivar is set for partial.  @doc is set to @document_list.first, so tests are run against SolrDocument not a Mash.
ca87858 SolrHelper spec changed to use new return values of @solr_helper.get_search_results.  New spec added to make sure @document_list contents match @response.docs contents. Specs that tested for size of @response.docs now also test to make sure @document_list is the same size.
16f1953 document list iterates through @document_list ivar instead of @response.docs, so it's iterating through actual SolrDocuments
d1e7eea index action adjusted for new return format of get_search_results, saving returned values in both @response and @document_list
