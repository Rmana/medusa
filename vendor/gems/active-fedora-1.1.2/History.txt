1.1.2 

Bug: Model.find_by_solr fails when you pass it an argument of :all
Testing: Updated RSpec tests to run against localhost:8983 with Fedora 3.3 (instead of localhost:8080 with Fedora 3.2).  This means you can use a copy of hydra-jetty from http://github.com/hydraproject/hydra-jetty
Testing: Reduced the amount of noise output to the shell during tests

1.1.1 2010-03-22

Bug: .load_objects wipes out datastream attributes from model-defined datastreams (ie. label and mimeType)

1.1.0 2010-03-20

Feature #822: Export & Ingest Fedora Objects

1.0.9 2010-03-10

!! Requires a new Solr schema by default.  We recommend updating solr with the schema.xml located at http://bitbucket.org/mediashelf/active_fedora/src/tip/solr/config/schema.xml.  If you want to keep using the old schema.xml, you must save the solr mappings file from http://bitbucket.org/mediashelf/active_fedora/src/tip/config/solr_mappings_af_0.1.yml as config/solr_mappings.yml in your application(s).

Bundled ruby-fedora into active-fedora, removing external gem dependency

Field names now map to solr field names using solr_mappings.yml.  You can put your own into RAILS_ROOT/config/solr_mappings.yml or rely on the default within the gem.
