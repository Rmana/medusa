# Stanford SolrHelper is a controller layer mixin. It is in the controller scope: request params, session etc.
# 
# NOTE: Be careful when creating variables here as they may be overriding something that already exists.
# The ActionController docs: http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/Base.html
#
# Override these methods in your own controller for customizations:
# 
# class HomeController < ActionController::Base
#   
#   include Stanford::SolrHelper
#   
#   def solr_search_params
#     super.merge :per_page=>10
#   end
#   
# end
#
module Stanford::SaltControllerHelper
  def retrieve_descriptor
    # We should be grabbing this from the collection_facet param, but there's only one collection so its hard-coded.
    #collection_id = params[:collection_facet]
    collection_id = "sc0340"
    @descriptor = Stanford::EadDescriptor.retrieve( collection_id )
