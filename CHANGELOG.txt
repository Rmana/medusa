0.0.0 2010-03-30

Upgraded to Blacklight 2.4 using a git subtree

== Notes

lost support for switching indexes at query time 
forced to edit Blacklight's routes.rb to expose catalog/{id}/edit 
* setting the edit_catalog_path separately failed


#	modified:   vendor/plugins/blacklight/lib/blacklight.rb
## this includes a hack to smooth over the usage of Blacklight.solr_config, but SHOULD BE REPLACED
