h1. Hydra -- Overview

h2. The Pieces

h3. Hydra Plugin

<span class="feature">Customizable Framework for building repository-driven applications</span>
<span class="feature">Flexible access controls</span>

h4. Controllers

* integration of ActiveFedora & Solrizer
* REST API

h4. Views

* basic views for uploader
* helper methods for editable metadata
* javascript code that works with the views & controllers

h4. Access Controls Enforcement

Uses Hydra rightsMetadata schema, which is indexed into Solr in order to allow for enforcement on all Read, Write, Edit and Search/Discover actions.  

* re-usable API hooks for using and/or extending enforcement logic
* REST API methods for adding/editing permissions
* automatically indexes rights metadata into Solr
* supports gated discovery out of the box

h3. Blacklight

<span class="feature">Next-Gen Content-Aware Search & Discovery</span>

h3. Solrizer

<span class="feature">Customizable indexing</span>

h3. Hydrangea 

<span class="feature">Reference implementation</span>
<span class="feature">Slick editor UI features</span>
<span class="feature">MODS support</span>

Example implementation of the complete Hydra stack, which consists of Blacklight + Hydra Framework + Hydra Models & Model-specific Views all sitting on top of Fedora and Solr.  In addition to serving as a starting point for those looking to use the Hydra framework, Hydrangea will also serve as a reference example as we discover and settle upon new best practices for building Hydra-powered applications.

* Full Hydra framework installed & tested
* Reference examples of Hydra models & views (Articles & Datasets) with MODS metadata
* Example views for editing object-level permissions
* Sample URL routing
* Placeholder user & group management
** works for demo & testing, but should be replaced with your institution's user/group management solution (ie. LDAP) in real deployment
* Sample Metadata Mappings (using OM)
** MODS Articles
** Hydra Rights Metadata

h3. Hydra-Jetty

This is a copy of Jetty, the lightweight Java Application Container, with Fedora and Solr pre-installed and configured to work with Hydra applications.  You can use this to get your development, testing and demo environments set up with minimal hassle.

Hydra-Jetty is not meant for use for production deployment.  In production environments, you should set up an application container like Tomcat and point the "production" section of config/fedora.yml and config/solr.yml to point to that production system's URL.

h3. Fedora

<span class="feature">Flexible preservation-oriented storage service</span>

h3. Solr

<span class="feature">Robust, flexible faceted search</span>

h2. Hydra Heads

Hydra Heads are independently built & distributed Hydra-powered applications built to suit specific users and specific content types. 

h3. Examples of Hydra Heads

A number of Hydra heads are in the works.  Some of them already exist in pre-Hydra form and will be updated to use the Hydra framework once Hydra 1.0 is released.  Some Hydra Heads include:

* Articles & Publications Tracker (Institutional Repository)
* Scientific Dataset Curation
* ETD (Electronic Theses & Dissertations) Submission
* Scanned Manuscripts
* Everyday (Born Digital) Archival Materials

These are just a few examples.  Please feel free to create your own, and contact the Hydra community to see if anyone else shares your interest.  Someone may already be working on a similar application.

h3. Sharing/Re-using Hydra Content Types

In order to enable content-specific behaviors and displays, you must define a new content type, which consists of:

* Hydra models 
** datastreams & metadata mappings
** model-specific behaviors 
* Model-specific views (Search Result, Show/Details, Edit)

You can share Hydra content types by putting the code into Rails Plugins.

h2. The Code

h3. Distribution

All of the code that we've written as part of Hydra, as well as some of the code that we rely on, is all hosted in public Github repositories.  Some portions of Hydra are distributed as Rails plugins that you can install into your rails applications.  Other portions of Hydra are distributed as Ruby gems, which can be incorporated into any Ruby application. 

h3. Tested ... Thoroughly

We use the following technologies to test our code.  Our continuous integration server (we use Hudson) runs all of the automated tests against any code changes.

RSpec -- unit testing of code
Cucumber -- story-driven integration/acceptance tests
Celerity (coming soon) -- automated javascript testing
Manual User Testing (provided by Stanford University Libraries)
