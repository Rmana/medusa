h1. Libra Open Access

h2. Introduction and Installation Instructions

Libra Open Access is self-submission application for open-access publications.

Libra OA is an extension and customization of Hydrangea, the reference implementation of the Hydra framework.

For a more thorough overview of the Hydra framework, see "HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea/blob/master/HYDRA_OVERVIEW.textile

For instructions on how to build and run Libra OA, please refer to the "Hydrangea project":http://github.com/projecthydra/hydrangea

To pre-populate Libra OA with a set of fixture objects, run the following rake task:
rake libra_oa:default_fixtures:load

To overwrite the pre-packaged fedora instance, make the desired changes to fedora/conf/fedora.fcfg and then run the following rake task(s):
If you already have a jetty running:
  rake hydra:jetty:stop 
To load your changes (this task will automatically start your jetty):
  rake hydra:jetty:load

Cucumber Usage:

Additional rake tasks are provided for adding features that override or extend core functionality:  

<pre>
rake cucumber:local_with_core
rake cucumber:local
rake cucumber:core
</pre>

For further information, see "Cucumber Usage":README_CUCUMBER.textile
