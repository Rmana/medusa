=Not sure how much of the below is relevant ... 

If it is, shouldn't it go in the docs above?  What is the purpose of THIS doc?  It partially overlaps the others, but implies they are incomplete (missing info here), or this is incomplete, or something ...

==Getting Started

Export or checkout a copy of blacklight from RubyForge. You'll need a Subversion client to do the following:

  svn export svn+ssh://rubyforge.org/var/svn/blacklight/trunk blacklight


==Installing Dependencies


===Ruby and Ruby Gems
Information on installing Ruby and Ruby Gems can be found:
	
	http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/
	http://www.rubygems.org/read/chapter/3


===ImageMagick - "ImageMagick® is a software suite to create, edit, and compose bitmap images."
Blacklight features a user feedback form. The form makes use of the "simple_captcha" plugin (included). In order for this form to work properly, the ImageMagick libraries must be installed. You can follow the instructions here http://www.imagemagick.org/script/install-source.php for installing from source or install a binary from here: http://www.imagemagick.org/script/binary-releases.php

On fedora, you can try:

	sudo yum install ImageMagick ImageMagick-devel

Test your installation of ImageMagick:

	convert -version

You should see something like:
  
  Version: ImageMagick 6.4.5 2008-11-04 Q16 OpenMP http://www.imagemagick.org
  Copyright: Copyright (C) 1999-2008 ImageMagick Studio LLC


===RMagick - "RMagick is an interface between the Ruby programming language and the ImageMagick® and GraphicsMagick image processing libraries."
RMagick is used to "talk" to ImageMagick. It can be installed by using the Ruby Gems installer:

	sudo gem install rmagick

Test your RMagick installation:
	
	irb
	require 'rubygems'
	require 'RMagick'

* tip: If you get an error about a shared object file not found, try setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH before starting irb. If setting this path works, you'll need to set it before starting the Rails server as well.


===Setup
Within a shell, move into the downloaded trunk directory:

  cd blacklight

Start solr:
	
	./scripts/start_solr (starts solr and availability service)

Then change into the "rails" directory:

	cd rails

Copy the config/database.example file to config/database.yml and make your database config changes:
	
	cp config/database.example config/database.yml


Copy the config/solr.example file to config/solr.yml and make your solr config changes:
	
	cp config/solr.example config/solr.yml

Run the database migrations
	
	rake db:migrate
	
Build the Vendorized Gems
  cd vendor/plugins/blacklight
  rake gems:build

Start the web server:
	open new terminal window
	cd <directory of blacklight/rails>
	./script/server
